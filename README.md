## Git notes
The `master` branch is protected and requires a pull request to merge code in. Pull requests require one reviewer's approval.

To keep things clean, suggest naming feature branches as `dev/<feature name>` or `dev/<developer name>/<feature name>` if only one person will be contributing to that feature.

# Music-Visualizer
Group project for CSC 475: Music Retrieval Techniques

## Git notes
The `master` branch is protected and requires a pull request to merge code in. Pull requests require one reviewer's approval.

To keep things clean, suggest naming feature branches as `dev/<feature name>` or `dev/<developer name>/<feature name>` if only one person will be contributing to that feature. 

## Package Dependencies
All files in the 'color-mapping' sub-folder will require downloading the 'zsa-descriptors' package within Max's package manager
